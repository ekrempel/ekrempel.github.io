Welcome
=======

This is the private website from Erik Krempel.

I studied computer science at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](http://www.kit.edu) in Germany. Currently I'm working as group head at [Fraunhofer IOSB](http://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/servlet/is/11/) in the department for *secure communication architecture* (SKA). My research group *identity management* focuses on privacy, data protection and usage control. Please have a look at [Contact](contact/index.html) if you wish to contact me.

Initially I bought this domain for the email address. Because an empty website looks so sad, I created this one until I have some other purpose. Maybe I will set up a blog in the near future (typed 2011, so do not count on it). Additionally it was a fun way to test [Jekyll](jekyll/index.html).
