##Welcome##

This is the private website from Erik Krempel. I studied computer science at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](http://www.kit.edu) in Germany. Currently I'm working as group head at [Fraunhofer IOSB](http://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/servlet/is/11/) in the department for secure communication architecture (SKA). My research group identity management focuses on privacy, data protection and usage control. Please have a look at [Contact](contact/index.html) if you wish to contact me.

Initially I bought this domain for the email address. Because an empty website looks so sad, I created this one until I have some other purpose. Maybe I will set up a blog in the near future (typed 2011, so do not count on it). Additionally it was a fun way to play with Jekyll.

##Jekyll##

Jekyll is a Ruby-based static site generator.  You write your content in Markdown or HTML, deliver a layout and Jekyll generates static HTML. 

You may think this quite useless as most web hosters already offer a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) or similar tools. They are comfortable, you can choose between hundreds of different design and you get an CMS for fast editing your articles. So why would I want a static HTML website as back in the '90s?

Static HTML is lightning fast and resource-efficient. There is no need for a full [LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) setup with database and dynamic languages on the server. This makes the system robust and safe against most common web exploits such as XSS, CSRF and all kind of SQL injections. So I decided to create one of this rare old style websites.

Additional you can host your website's Markdown files directly at [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and get git versioning of your entire website. To update my website I just have to push my changes and GitHub does the static HTML generating and deployment for me. 

When you want to learn more about Jekyll visit their [website](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) or have a look at the documentation from [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) .
