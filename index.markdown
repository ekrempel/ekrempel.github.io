## Welcome
### Welcome 1


This is the private website from Erik Krempel.

I studied computer science at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](http://www.kit.edu) in Germany, in 2017 I finished my PhD in computer science. Currently I am working as group head at [Fraunhofer IOSB](http://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/servlet/is/11/) in the department for *Interactive Analysis and Diagnosis* ([IAD](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/servlet/is/69288/)).
My research group *Identity Management* focuses on privacy, data protection and usage control. Please have a look at [Contact](contact/index.html), if you wish to contact me.

Initially I bought this domain for the email address. Because an empty website looks so sad, I created this one until I have some other purpose. Nowadays it surves as blog with an extremly low update frequency where I mainly document private projects.
