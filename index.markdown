##Welcome##

This is the private website from Erik Krempel. I'm a computer science student at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](http://www.kit.edu) in Germany. Currently I'm a research assistant and writing my diploma thesis at [Fraunhofer IOSB](http://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/servlet/is/11/) in the department for secure communication architecture (SKA).


##This Website##

Initially I bought this domain for the email address. Because an empty website looks so sad, I created this one until I have some other purpose. Maybe I will set up a blog. Additionally it was a fun way to play with Jekyll.


##Jekyll##

Jekyll is a Ruby-based static site generator.  You write your content in Markdown or HTML, deliver a layout and Jekyll generates static HTML.

###But why?:###
You can just set up a wordpress as your private blog. It is comfortable, you can choose between hundreds of different design and you get an CMS for fast editing your articles.  Everyone can do it, there are at least 100 different tutorial on the web.

###The answer is easy:###
The generated static HTML is lightning fast and resource-efficient, because there is no need for a database or dynamic languages. I won't have many updates so a CMS is overpower and brings unnecessary security risks. Furthermore, I think that a lot of private websites don't deserve a full [LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) setup to deploy some pictures of the cat. So I decided to create on of this rare old style websites.
