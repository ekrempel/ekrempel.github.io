##Welcome##

This is the private website from Erik Krempel. I studied computer science at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](http://www.kit.edu) in Germany. Currently I'm working as a researcher at [Fraunhofer IOSB](http://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/servlet/is/11/) in the department for secure communication architecture (SKA).


##This Website##

Initially I bought this domain for the email address. Because an empty website looks so sad, I created this one until I have some other purpose. Maybe I will set up a blog. Additionally it was a fun way to play with Jekyll.


##Jekyll##

Jekyll is a Ruby-based static site generator.  You write your content in Markdown or HTML, deliver a layout and Jekyll generates static HTML. 

You may think this quite useless as most webhosters already offer a wordpress or similar setup. It is comfortable, you can choose between hundreds of different design and you get an CMS for fast editing your articles.  Everyone can do it, there are at least 10.000 different tutorial on the web. So why would I want a static HTML website as back in the 90'?

The generated static HTML is lightning fast and resource-efficient, because there is no need for a database or dynamic languages. Furthermore, I think that a lot of private websites don't deserve a full [LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) setup to deploy some pictures of the cat. So I decided to create on of this rare old style websites.

Additional you can host your website's markdown files directly at [GitHub](www.github.com) and you have git versioning of your entire website. To update my website I just have to push my changes and GitHub does all the work.
