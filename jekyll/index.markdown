##Jekyll##

Jekyll is a Ruby-based static site generator.  You write your content in Markdown or HTML, deliver a layout and Jekyll generates static HTML. 

You may think this quite useless as most web hosters already offer a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) or similar tools. They are comfortable, you can choose between hundreds of different design and you get an CMS for fast editing your articles. So why would I want a static HTML website as back in the '90s?

Static HTML is lightning fast and resource-efficient. There is no need for a full [LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) setup with database and dynamic languages on the server. This makes the system robust and safe against most common web exploits such as XSS, CSRF and all kind of SQL injections. So I decided to create one of this rare old style websites.

Additional you can host your website's Markdown files directly at [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and get git versioning of your entire website. To update my website I just have to push my changes and GitHub does the static HTML generating and deployment for me.
