Contact
=======

The easiest way is via [email](mailto:spamrotate6@erikkrempel.net).

For your convenience this is a real address and you don't have to solve a captcha here. For my convenience is it a temporary address which gets dumped once I receive too much spam over it. I will deliver a regular address after first contact.

When you are looking for business contact information check my [XING profile](https://www.xing.com/profile/Erik_Krempel). 
You can also head to my [ResarchGate account](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Erik_Krempel) to learn more about my academic work.
