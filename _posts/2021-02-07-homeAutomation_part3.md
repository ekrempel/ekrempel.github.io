title: Eltako actuators and openHAB
---

In this blog post I will give you a short abstract how I managed to get my Eltako F4SR14-LED, FUD14 and FSB14 actuators working with [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/). I do not aim to write a self-sufficient how-to for you, but want to show some of the things I learned during my journey. It should go without saying that I am in no way responsible if the documented method does not work for you. Good sources for further reading are the [EnOcean part of the openHAB documentation](https://www.openhab.org/addons/bindings/enocean/) and the github page of the [EnOcean Binding](https://github.com/fruggy83/openocean). Another great source for the documentation of Eltako actuators is the [wiki of FHEM](https://wiki.fhem.de/wiki/EnOcean_Starter_Guide#UTE-Teach-In).

In the last post I already mentioned that working with Eltako actuators is more complicated that using the EnOcean autodiscover feature as they do not support the UTE teach-in. So what you have to do is the following:

1. Great an new Thing according to your actuators
2. Define a teach-in button in the openHAB UI
3. Prepare your actuators for teach-in
4. Trigger a teach-in via the UI
5. Put your actuators back into default mode

This rather laborious process is not a fault of the Binding developers of openHAB but to the limitation of the Eltako actuators. The only thing the openHAB developers could do is to present you with an teach-in button while creating a Thing to streamline the process a little. Maybe this will be integrated in the future when we see more usage of the UI-based configuration. 

### EnOceanIds
Before we can get started you need to get an understanding of EnOceanIds. They are the unique identifiers of all the actuators in your system. In order to teach an actuator you need to provide openHAB with the EnOceanId of the device. There are at least two ways to find them. 

If you are replacing/adding to the Wibutler as I was doing, you can see the EnOceanId in the Wibutler App. This is the easy way.
 
If this is not possible you will need to use the [PCT14 Software](https://www.eltako.com/de/software/gfvs-software-pct14.html) and connect to your system to find the baseId. The first actuator will have the EnOceanId = baseId + 1. Here it gets a bit messy as different actuators have a different set of channels and every channel uses a Id.

* Eltako FSB14 -> 2 Channels
* Eltako F4SR14-LED -> 4 Channels
* Eltako FUD14 -> 1 Channel

I try to give you an example so that you can compute your EnOceanIds. Lets assume your system looks like this: F4SR14-LED, F4SR14-LED, FSB14, FUD14 and your baseId is: ffe2c000. The first F4SR14-LED has the EnOceanId ffe2c001 and uses four channels. The second F4SR14-LED has the EnOceanId ffe2c005 and uses four channels. The FSB14 has the EnOceanId ffe2c009 and uses two channels. **The second tricky part of EnOceanIds is, that they are written as Hexadecimal**. Therefore the EnOceanId of the FUD14 is ffe2c00b and not as you might assume ffe2c010. There is an excel file at the github page of the EnOcean Binding that can help you to compute your ids: (https://github.com/fruggy83/openocean/wiki/stuff/openhab2.xlsx). Once you know your Ids you can start programming them in.

###  [F4SR14-LED](ttps://www.elektroland24.de/smarthome/Eltako-Funk/Schalten-per-Funk-oxid-1/Funkaktoren-Schalten-REG/Eltako-F4SR14-LED-Funk-Schaltrelais-fuer-230V-LED-s-4-Kanaele.html)

The easiest actuator to teach-in in my setup is the F4SR14-LED. It controls up to four different lights. To work with it we start by creating the correct Thing. Go to Settings -> Things and press the "+" in the lower right corner. Here select EnOcean Binding and Switching/Dimming Actuator. 

![EnOcean UI to configure a F4SR14-LED Thing](/images/EnOcean_F4SR14_createThing.png){: width="600" }

Make sure to select the EnOcean bridge you configured earlier. 

Leave the Sender Id empty, as the Binding will select the correct Id by itself and create the Thing. Use the EnOceanId you have collected earlier.

After creating the Thing we will have to teach it to the actuator. Go to Settings -> Thing and select the newly created Thing. Switch to the Tab Channels and activate Show advanced. Here you will find the Channel "Teach In". 
![EnOcean UI to configure a F4SR14-LED Thing](/images/openhab_enocean_teachin.png){: width="600" }

Select it and press "Add Link to Item...". In this dialogue select "Create a new Item" and press "Link".

### Before we start with teach-in
There are three important things you should be doing before going any further.

1. Make photos of all you actuators
2. Use the PCT14 software to make a backup of your EnOcean settings
3. Make sure that nobody will accidentally press any of your EnOcean switches when you activated teach-in

Now we created the Thing and prepared a software button to trigger the teach-in event. Next we will have to prepare the F4SR14-LED actuator to teach him a switch. You can find more information in the [official documentation](https://www.eltako.com/fileadmin/downloads/de/_bedienung/F4SR14-LED_30014076-1_dt.pdf). Use a small screwdriver to put you F4SR14-LED in the teach-in mode. Set the lower selector to the channel you want to configure. After that set the middle selector to "LRN". The LED of the actuator will blink. While it is blinking press the teach-in button we defined in the last step. The blinking of the actuator will stop and teach-in is finished. (Sometimes you have to press the teach-in button a second time until it is accepted, don't be alarmed.)

![Set the F4SR14-LED into teach-in](/images/F4SR14-LED.png){: width="200" }

**Please note that the actuator will not accept any switches until you put it back into default!** Please remember to put the lower selector back to "AUTO" and the middle selector to "AUTO 1".

You now should have created your first Thing and can test it. Go to Settings -> Things and select your newly created switch. Select the Tab Channels and select the Channel "Switch". Select it and press "Add Link to Item...". In this dialogue select "Create a new Item" and press "Link". You should now be able to use this switch to control you lights.

### [Eltako FUD14](https://www.elektroland24.de/smarthome/Eltako-Funk/Dimmen-per-Funk/Funkaktoren-Dimmen-REG/Eltako-FUD14-Universal-Dimmschalter-LED-ESL-bis-400W.html?listtype=search&searchparam=fud14&&order=&&order=#FUD14) (Dimmer for one light)

Luckily the FUD14 is pretty similar to the F4SR14-LED. Let us start by defining a Thing for the FUD14. Go to Settings -> Things and press the "+" in the lower right corner. Here select EnOcean Binding and Switching/Dimming Actuator. Make sure to select your Bridge and enter the EnOceanId. In the EEP for Sending Commands select "Gateway command - dimming (A5_38_08 sub command 0x02)" as described in the [Bindung documentation](https://www.openhab.org/addons/bindings/enocean/) of the FUD14. At he point EEP for Receiving States you must select "Message with dimming value (A5_38_08 sub command 0x02)" and create the Thing.

![EnOcean UI to configure a FUD14 Thing](/images/EnOcean_FUD14_createThing.png){: width="600" }

After creating the Thing we continue to create a teach-in button as we did for the F4SR14-LED. After that we activate teach-in for the FUD14 as described in the [manual](https://www.eltako.com/fileadmin/downloads/de/_bedienung/FUD14_30014005-2_dt.pdf). Use a small screwdriver to put the topmost selector to "PCR" and the middle selector to "LRN". The led start blinking. While it is blinking press the teach-in button we defined in the last step. The blinking of the actuator will stop and teach-in is finished. (Sometimes you have to press the teach-in button a second time until it is accepted, don't be alarmed.)

![Set the FUD14 into teach-in](/images/FUD14.png){: width="200" }

**Please note that the actuator will not accept any switches until you put it back into default!** Please remember to put the topmost selector back to "AUTO" and the middle selector to your desired lowest dimming level (somewhere in the middle in my case). Now you should be able to create an Item to test controlling your newly created Thing.

### [Eltako FSB14](https://www.elektroland24.de/smarthome/Eltako-Funk/Rollladen-per-Funk/Funkaktoren-Rollladen/Eltako-FSB14-Schaltaktor-Rollladen-mit-2-Kanaelen.html) (Controls up to two rollershutters)

The last part of the post will show you how to add FSB14 to control your rollershutters. The basic process of the same as for the FSB14 and F4SR14-LED but the rollershutters need some additional work. Go to Settings -> Things and press the "+" in the lower right corner. Here select EnOcean Binding and Rollershutter Actuator. Make sure to select your Bridge and enter the EnOceanId. In the EEP for Sending Commands select "Eltako FSB14/61/71". At the point EEP for Receiving States select "Eltako FSB14/61/71" and create the Thing.

![EnOcean UI to configure a FSB14 Thing](/images/EnOcean_FUD14_createThing.png){: width="600" }

After creating the Thing we continue to create a teach-in button as we did for the other actuators. After that we activate teach-in for the FSB14 as described in the [manual](https://www.eltako.com/fileadmin/downloads/de/_bedienung/FSB14_30014004-2_dt.pdf). Use a small screwdriver to put the topmost selector to "180", that will enable you to teach-in a Thing for the fist channel (select "200" for the second channel). After selecting the channel put the middle selector to "LRN". The led start blinking. While it is blinking press the teach-in button we defined in the last step. The blinking of the actuator will stop and teach-in is finished. (Sometimes you have to press the teach-in button a second time until it is accepted, don't be alarmed.)

![Set the FSB14 into teach-in](/images/FSB14.png){: width="200" }

**Please note that the actuator will not accept any switches until you put it back into default!** Please remember to put the topmost and middle selector back into their original setting. Now you should be able to create an Item to test controlling your newly created Thing.

After creating the Thing we have to do two additional configuration steps. First measure the time it takes your rollershutter to go from completely open to completely closed. For my normal windows this time is around 17 seconds. Go to your Things and select the newly created Rollershutter Actuator. Here go to the Tab Channels, select the Rollershutter Channel and press "Configure Channel". Please note that the option "Configure Channel" only becomes visible after you selected the channel. 

![EnOcean UI to configure a FSB14 (part1)](/images/EnOcean_FSB14_configureThing1.svg){: width="600" }

In the new dialogue configure the measured time.

![EnOcean UI to configure a FSB14 (part2)](/images/EnOcean_FSB14_configureThing2.svg){: width="600" }

You can now create a Thing and use it to control your rollershutter. Unfortunately the default setting will give you wrong readings of the opening / closing level. To fix that we have to set an additional option. To to so go to the created Item. Here click "Add Metadata" and in the menu select "Auto-update". In the new dialogue set "Force auto-update" to false but clicking it two times until the check box is unselected.

Congratulation, you should now know everything to teach-in and configure all your FSB14, FUD14 and F4SR14-LED actuators.
